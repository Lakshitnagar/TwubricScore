# TwubricScore
Rubric Score for a twitter account
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubric_(academic))

If you have an account on Twitter, you’d probably know that apart from normal people, there are:

1. bots
2. accounts that have zero activity. These were probably created by people unknowingly only for them to never come back and use it again.

While it is flattering to have these tweeps follow you, you’d want to weed them out at some point, I think (I would). 
Here is simple web app that allows a Twitter user to review his followers, view their twubric “scores” filter & sort them and then decide to optionally remove certain followers.
